        Narrow streets with cobblehead stones, tiny blue and white houses and on every corner you’ll find some local fishermen or charming old ladies. Ericeira is a typically Portuguese fisherman’s village on the atlantic coast, turned into a surfersvillage over the last decade. Being the first World Surf Reserve in Europe, it has a magical draw to surfers from all over the world. There is always a place to peek at the ocean and the golden sand beaches with wild cliffs are spread out all over the coast, because the city is build on a rock. It’s the perfect place to learn how to surf, go hiking, enjoy sunsets and drink the best wine.

    <p class="full-width">
      Ericeira is the first World Surf Reserve in Europe, since october 2011. It means that part of the coastal area in and around Ericeira is a protected area, and can never be changed in a way the waves and/or coast is affected. The World Surfing Reserves (WSR) represent a commitment to identify and preserve our planet’s most extraordinary surfing areas and the habitats around them. So what makes the Ericeira coastline so special? It’s quite unique; there is a very high density of high quality waves in only a couple of kilometers. You’ll find gentle waves that break on sand for beginners as well as extreme reefbreaks for experienced surfers. Want to learn more?

      <h3 class="white">and the sea temperature?</h3>
      <p>With an average of 17 degrees, the sea temperature in Ericeira is pretty low compared to other southern European locations. A cold water stream runs through the Atlantic ocean and hits Portugal right at the coast of Ericeira. The ocean is warmest in August, September and October, when temperatures can reach 21 degrees. If you want to go surfing you’ll need to bring or rent a wetsuit. In autumn a 3.2 millimeter is warm enough, spring and early summer a 4.3 millimeter and in the winter months you will be kept warm only by a 5.4 millimeter suit. Some also prefer booties.</p>
