    “Portugal is like California with less people, better food, less plastic, less crowd and less fake. It’s like a big neighbourhood and that’s sweet. It’s cheap and there’s no violence, no danger, no terrorism, and that’s probably the best thing ever. It’s a good place to say the least. Don’t come on a diet though, eating is the best way to really get to know Portugal and the Portuguese”

      Part of the beautiful coastline of Ericeira, and therefore the surf spots, is protected area being Europe’s only World Surf Reserve. The coast is littered with golden sand beaches, stunning cliffs and great waves for everyone; beginners, intermediates and advanced surfers. Next to that, the town of Ericeira is a most pleasant place to stay. You’ll find tiny blue and white houses, small cobblestone streets, sunny terraces and friendly people. All a stone’s throw away from the beautiful city of Lisbon, Sintra and Cascais. Read more on where to surf in our Ericeira Surf Spot Guide (link)
